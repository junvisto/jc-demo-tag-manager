Tag manager:

When measuring effectiveness of your site, you need analytics tools.

- Traditionally developers hard-code tracking scripts directly into the website, which requires engineering effort and deployment time for every change.

- Instead a developer or anyone with access can implement Google Tag Manager (GTM) once on the site. After that all tracking logic is managed within GTM.

**When GTM loads on the site, it can dynamically trigger tracking tags for Google Analytics, Google Ads, and other platforms without requiring further code changes.**

**This is a demo site hosted on GitHub. There’s no backend. Just a dummy website so we can focus purely on GA and GTM**
